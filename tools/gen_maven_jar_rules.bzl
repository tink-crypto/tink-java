    Generates rules that generate Maven jars for a given package.

      name: Given a name, this function generates 3 rules: a compiled package
        name.jar, a source package name-src.jar and a Javadoc package
        name-javadoc.jar.
      deps: A combination of the deps of java_single_jar and javadoc_library
      resources: A list of resource files. Files must be stored in
        src/main/resources. Mapping rules: src/main/resources/a/b/c.txt will be
        copied to a/b/c.txt in the output jar.
      root_packages: See javadoc_library
      shaded_packages: These packages will be shaded, according to the rules
        specified in shading_rules.
      shading_rules: The shading rules, must specified when shaded_packages is present.
        Rules file format can be found at https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/third_party/jarjar/java/com/tonicsystems/jarjar/help.txt.
      exclude_packages: See javadoc_library

      manifest_lines: lines to put in the output manifest file (manifest
